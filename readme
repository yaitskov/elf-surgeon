  *** Intro ***

elf-surgeon is toolkit to change existing elf files so libraries or executables.

Now two operation is supported:

  1)  Make local function globally accessible at the expense of another existing global function
      in the same elf file. After this modification you can use dlsym to call local function.
      Victim global function becomes unavailable. Both functions are pointed by their names.

  2)  Set manually size of local or global function in elf file by its name.


The program requires an elf file with symtab and dynsym sections.


  *** Usage ***

  ./elf-surgeon set-func-size -i libsomelib.so.1 -o libsomelib.so.1 -v num_of_all_chars -s 12300
  ./elf-surgeon global-func -i libsomelib.so.1 -o libsomelib.so.1 -l local_func -v num_of_all_chars
